## Windows 10 BitLocker Key Recovery (Using MBAM)

For Windows 10 devices, you can recover your BitLocker key using the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) self-service portal.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to the MBAM self-service portal:
    [http://mbam01/selfserve](http://mbam01/selfserve)

2.  **Log in** with your corporate credentials. You may need to use your usual username and password.

3.  **Identify your device.** The portal should display a list of devices associated with your account. Find the device for which you need the BitLocker key. You might need to match the device name or a partial key ID shown on your locked screen.

4.  **Click "Get Key"** or a similar option next to your device. The recovery key will be displayed.

5.  **Carefully type the recovery key** into your locked Windows 10 screen. Remember that the key is case-sensitive and often contains hyphens that you might need to type.

6.  **If you are unable to find your key** or access the MBAM portal, please contact the IT helpdesk for assistance.

## Windows 11 BitLocker Key Recovery (Using Intune)

For Windows 11 devices managed by Intune, your BitLocker recovery key can typically be accessed through the Intune Company Portal or by an administrator.

**Steps for Users (Company Portal - if enabled):**

1.  If you have access to another device, try opening the **Company Portal app** or visiting the Company Portal website.
2.  **Log in** with your corporate credentials.
3.  **Find your device** in the list of devices.
4.  Look for an option like "Get BitLocker recovery key" or "View details" for your device. If available, your recovery key will be displayed.

**Steps for IT Helpdesk (Administrator Access):**

If the user cannot retrieve the key themselves or if the Company Portal option isn't available, an IT administrator can retrieve the key from the Microsoft Intune admin center:

1.  Navigate to the **Microsoft Intune admin center**.
