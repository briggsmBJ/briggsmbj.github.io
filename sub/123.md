## Windows 10 BitLocker Key Recovery (Using MBAM)

For Windows 10 devices, you can recover your BitLocker key using the Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) self-service portal.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to the MBAM self-service portal:

3.  **Log in** with your corporate credentials. You may need to use your usual username and password.

4.  **Identify your device.** The portal should display a list of devices associated with your account. Find the device for which you need the BitLocker key. You might need to match the device name or a partial key ID shown on your locked screen.

5.  **Click "Get Key"** or a similar option next to your device. The recovery key will be displayed.

6.  **Carefully type the recovery key** into your locked Windows 10 screen. Remember that the key is case-sensitive and often contains hyphens that you might need to type.

7.  **If you are unable to find your key** or access the MBAM portal, please contact the IT helpdesk for assistance.

2.  Go to **Devices > All devices**.
3.  **Search for the user's device** by name.
4.  Select the device, then click on **"Recovery keys"** under the "Monitor" section.
5.  The BitLocker recovery key(s) for the device will be listed. Provide the correct key to the user.
